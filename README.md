### About
- Chaos Game is based on the mathematical subset of Chaos Theory related to fractal generation.
- This application is best used to demonstrate the Sierpinski Triangle as pictured below.
- This application works by having the user pick n number of fixed points and a small plotting dot. The application then picks a random fixed point and creates a new plotting dot half way between the fixed point and the previous plotting dot. This process is then continued over 24,000 iterations.

### Example
- Here&apos;s an example of the Sierpinski Triangle plotted using Chaos Game
